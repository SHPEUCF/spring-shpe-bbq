        <h1> Who are we? </h1>
        <p>The Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) was founded in Los Angeles, California, in 1974 by a group of engineers employed by the city of Los Angeles. Their objective was to form a national organization of professional engineers to serve as role models in the Hispanic community. This organization made its way to Orlando in 1988.</p>
        <p>Our Chapter focuses on the Hispanic population at the University of Central Florida. For our members, we offer workshops, discussion panels, information sessions and much more to fully prepare our soon-to-be Engineers for the real world. Companies come to our Chapter to discuss a multitude of topics, such as how to write a winning resume, interviewing tips/techniques and what companies expect out of an entry-level Engineer.</p>
        <p>SHPE National's mission is to empower the Hispanic community, so we took it upon our Chapter to engage with the younger community around Orlando to inform them about the importance of STEM. We conduct school visits to middle and high schools through our SHPE Junior Program to present what technical professions are and how they affect our everyday life. We also monitor student competitions for SECME, a statewide program that enables younger students with hands-on projects with basic math and science applications.</p>
        <p>With almost 400 members, every day we're closer to reaching the entire Hispanic STEM community at the University of Central Florida. We are devoted to empowering our members to realize their fullest potential and to impact the world through STEM awareness, access, support, and development. Leadership is a key element for SHPE and we encourage all members to become leaders within our organization. Itâ€™s not only a great experience, but it allows you to meet other students and Chapters.</p>
